              If youâ€™re in need of more living space, finishing your basement is
              an excellent way to increase the size of your home. Add an
              additional bedroom, bathroom, bar, play area, or home theater.

              According to Remodeling Magazine, finishing your basement can
              bring a 70% return on investment. For example, if you spent
              $40,000 on improvements, it would increase the value of the
              property by about $28,000, which is more than what any other home
              improvement delivers. According to Nerdwallet (and Zenith), expect
              to spend 15-20% of your home value on finishing your basement.

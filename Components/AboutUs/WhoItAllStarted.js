Nicholas started the company because he couldnâ€™t shake the vision of wanting to see a better approach to construction and design. He was tired of hearing a negative response to contracting projects in the remodeling business, and wanted to do something about it. Zenith has since won several awards for innovative work and has added team members who share this passion. </Title>
